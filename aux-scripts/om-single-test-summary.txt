The lab results represent the baseline from which to make cultural decisions. Like calibrating a TDR measurement for soil moisture content based on subjective observations, the OM246 test should be thought of in the same context. Playability and overall green performance should be considered.

The TORV average line in the Organic Matter graphics represent the average of all TORV clients for the represented depth. Testing annually at the same time is recommended. Testing in spring and again in fall is also common practice for many properties if that is of interest. When the test is performed again, we will be able to:

- Add a trendline visualizing how the OM% is trending.
- Calculate the organic matter accumulated or lost over a known period.
- Using a known amount of topdressing applied, we can estimate/calculate the Amount of topdressing needed to maintain, increase, or decrease the organic matter.
- Consider obtaining an accurate topdressing rate per year to make this calculation possible. What is the estimated depth of all topdressing applications applied this year?
- [This video from the USGA](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/sand-topdressing-by-depth/) shows how to calculate the depth along with the required conversion equations.
- Cultural decisions such as aerification, verticutting, topdressing amounts/frequency can be influenced by tracking organic matter over time and established goals for organic matter targets.
