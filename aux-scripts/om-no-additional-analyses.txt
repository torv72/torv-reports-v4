Like calibrating a TDR measurement for soil moisture content based on subjective observations, the OM246 test should be thought of in the same context. Playability and overall green performance should be considered.
Using a known amount of topdressing applied, we can estimate/calculate the Amount of topdressing needed to maintain, increase, or decrease the organic matter.
- Consider obtaining an accurate topdressing rate per year to make this calculation possible. What is the estimated depth of all topdressing applications applied this year?
- [This video from the USGA](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/sand-topdressing-by-depth/) shows how to calculate the depth along with the required conversion equations.
- Cultural decisions such as aerification, verticutting, topdressing amounts/frequency can be influenced by tracking organic matter over time and established goals for organic matter targets.
